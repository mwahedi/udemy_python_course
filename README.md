# Python course Udemy
Did this course to refresh my memory on the basics a bit + to see if this is something that could possibly be recommended to other people.
Find a further discussion below. My work consisted of watching all videos in x2 speed & typing pythong alongside.
Using python version `3.8.10`, but I believe any version `>3.5` should work.

# Review

Just to have a space where I throw my thoughts down:
- I would have loved some excercises, I would recommend doing some python exercises e.g. [here](https://holypython.com/intermediate-python-exercises/) or [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/).
- I watched the videos on double speed and added my own thoughts on top + made sure to comment everything
- The files are not cleaned + I really didn't write down all of the first courses.
- I skipped chapter 15 because these are things I am using in my day to day work + the course is from 2017 (the standard matplotlib looked _bad_ back then. :D)
- Skipped chapter 16 because again numpy is standard in my day to day
- Skipped chapter 17 - I thought there would be a bit more about debugging, but the tutor introduces the pdb package, which I already know and use. In addition, if you want to use it for jupyter notebooks, you can use ipdb.
- I looked forward to chapter 18, but the examples the instructor build didn't work a lot of the times, unfortunately, but it was good to get a refresher on regex in general
- Overall, I believe the course would have benefitted from having a clear theory part, where the concept is explained before the instructor jumps into the coding part. In addition, excercises are very needed for this. I do not believe this'll help people in starting their own first python project. I would've loved pure python, instead of splitting up and talking a chapter about numpy, a chapter about plotting and a chapter about debugging.
- Missing: no discussion of the python data model, cpython, using a linter, style coding, using a proper IDE (the author uses sublime, which was questionable even back in 2017).
