# Python course Udemy

Just a quick refresher on some OOP & RegEx.
I mainly did this to get the certificate and it was free, because I realised that I don't have any license that tells people I know python. :D 
The badges should give some indication about the seriousness of this. ;)

Using python version `3.8.10`, but I believe any version `>3.5` should work.

# Review

Just to have a space where I throw my thoughts down:
- I would have loved some excercises, I would recommend doing some python exercises e.g. [here](https://holypython.com/intermediate-python-exercises/).
- I watched the videos on double speed and added my own thoughts on top + made sure to comment everything
- The files are not cleaned + I really didn't write down all of the first courses.
